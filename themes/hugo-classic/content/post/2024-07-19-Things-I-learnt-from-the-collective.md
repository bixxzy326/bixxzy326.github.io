As noordine asked me to write a note for myself that what i observed as a secretary, here it goes

- There is a constant need of our mind-share with our poeple and also with the new people.
- I should make them feel inclusive in every aspect and induce the learning into them.


### Experience that i got from SOTC to run an effective meeting

- make a clear agenda for every meeting
- meeting host should be clear to the point of what need to be discussed 
- maintain <5 attendees in the meeting
- make them feel included
- share them the responsibility
- make sure all ec members are attending when it is a decision making meeting
- have a peer-review for everyone and share their work done in the collective for the past month(drives and outcomes)
- Take minutes of meeting in rotation basis with attendees list, agenda, summary, date, time and opinions shared.
- If new people are more interested, include them and make them feel comfortable by asking their opinion. 
- keep a track of work that need to happen and the work that is happening
