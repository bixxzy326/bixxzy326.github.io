### Why I started using it??

I started using it because I found it cool and I wanted to be so too. It is also less of a pain in the butt compared to Windows. I got used to the Linux way of doing things and I find the way Linux does many things like

- It just works as the way I want
- the way I install programs
- the complete freedom of it
- the transparent nature of it all
- more appealing than Windows’ way of doing things.

So, I love Linux because it doesn’t get in my way as Windows does.

I'm using EndeavourOS with KDE and Plasma, these combo are a heaven-send for being able to make a genuinely functional theme that’s adjustable and capable of being flexible. But now, I'm also trying bspwm just to rice linux with the reddit folks suggessions(abso unixporn). Also, the customisation is just a french kiss. Its lightwight nature and its ability to run memory efficient on my laptop is also a defining factor.

I feel like when a problem occurs, I gained a confidence that I can very well overcome the issues over here and also there are lot of community forums out there to help out linux folks(proceeds to enters arch community forum and slammed out by saying RTFM...lol). There are lot more OS out there for different use case and many will suggest a newbie to a debian-gnome or Ubuntu or linux-mint or pop_os as it is straightforward and easy to use. Im not saying that others are like bit hard to figure out, as im using arch based one with kde plasma on it making it easy to study and work over my things. It does the things in an easy way that i dont have the pain in my ass.


Also more than the cool stuffs in linux, I chose linux becasue of the FOSS and the the concentual technology that i want and the privacy it offers. Luckily i got nice people around me with super-cool wide thinking tech nerds who advocates freedom in both technical accepts and political accepts which I felt comfortable with them.
