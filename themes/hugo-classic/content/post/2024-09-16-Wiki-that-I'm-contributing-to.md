## Started with my first wiki contribution

For a long time, I was planning to contribute wikipedia as a part of my archival process and long term helpful journey that people would benefit outta it, and then our collective hosted a mediawiki called FSHM wiki which inturn paved my path to contribute it. But I dont have a list of concrete plan to contribute considering my landscape.

By then, I get to see wiki page of Fosscell NITC, which they have a list of Campus guide which seems informational and helpful to anyone who wanna join there as a fresher. This prodded me to write wiki as a guide for SOTC and PU which would help people in University to know about other department activity, club, and what they could get benefitted from the department. 

### SOTC wiki

For sotc wiki, I want to push all the existing activities of SOTC like sessions, notes, workshops and other activites that we organize which would be both informative and display for upcoming students. I see PU as a special place which is a birth of many revolutionary ideas and movements to talk about the political nature of the landscape. As a part, our FOSS movement also will be a eyeopening for the students and this wiki will be a guide for them
