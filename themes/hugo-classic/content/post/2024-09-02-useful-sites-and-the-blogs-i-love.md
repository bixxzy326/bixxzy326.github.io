I wrote this list using some somewhat arbitrary constraints, to narrow it down from the maybe 150 blogs I have in my bookmark:

1. there are “a lot” of posts, for some arbitrary definition of “a lot” (there are so many blogs I love where the person has only written like 5 posts!)

2. the person has posted in the last 2 years (there are so many blogs I love that have mostly stopped posting!)

3. (obviously) that I like reading the blog
