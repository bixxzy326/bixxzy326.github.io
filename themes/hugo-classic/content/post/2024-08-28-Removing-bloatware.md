### What made me to do this

First of all, I dont need unnecessary propritory apps which I'm not using a while. 
The other main thing is I want to get rid of this Google, and badly want to remove all the google service including google play service and gfs.
The only thing I'm concerned is, if i remove all the google services, i cant use upi scanner apps, banking apps for Indian bank and such things which makes me to hold to remove these google service

### Why Im doing now??

Last week a incident happened which makes me feel bad is the toy which my neighbour meena akka bought from miniso a week back, I went to her home and just saw the toy and didn't even take a click, didnt even search regarding that, literally I didn't do anything related to this toy and we were having our phones beside and talking about the "Pannikutty(the toy name)".
