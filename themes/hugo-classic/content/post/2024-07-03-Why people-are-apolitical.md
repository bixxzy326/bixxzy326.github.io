This question always strikes me, whenever people over here are apolitical

- they are comfortable with the current political climate
- people doesn't care about how society is functioning or they may be extremely priveledged
- they will throw money and think that their problem disappear and not the society problem.
- they don't care about the social issues around them becasue it doesn't affect them.
- they may be willfully ignorant and they avoid forming opinion because it will burst their precious priveledged bubble
