### Why I need to have a server on my own

- just because i like it

- Im really interested in having my own little network of things to maintain and work on but i realized that without any big purpose of the equipment its just going to collect dust.

- Privacy, ditching google, owning my data, fun learning and hobby
 

We can run anything we want; it does not have to be limited to just websites; you could use it as a shared password manager, host a Mastodon server, use it as a home assistant, sync between devices and more
