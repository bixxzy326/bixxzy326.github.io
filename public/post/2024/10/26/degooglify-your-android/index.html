<p>Many of you know that you can use an Android without a Google account. What I find interesting, is, even if you choose not to login to your Google account, in order to use your device, you nevertheless have to agree to Google&rsquo;s terms of service!</p>
<p>So even though you may physically own the metal and plastic which comprises your device, and have the receipt to prove it, you do not own the right to use it.</p>
<p>The only known way around this is to replace the built-in operating system with something else. I really don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going with this, except to tell you how much this surprised me when I naively thought I would outsmart Google by not logging in.</p>
<p>Google however has a licence agreement with phone manufacturers to install Google&rsquo;s version of Android onto their phones since Google provides both stable updates and patches, as well as providing an whole ecosystem and the original &ldquo;Play Store&rdquo; with their crap security features.</p>
<p>Also the phone manufacturers get Google-Android for free! They only have to add their own custom packages and drivers for the hardware pertaining to that device.</p>
<p>That is what people &ldquo;want&rdquo; since it makes life easier for them and makes them all fuzzy inside to be monitored 24/7 by a search engine giant that has a main revenue of selling private data.</p>
<h3 id="why-degoogle-what-it-gives">why degoogle? what it gives</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Purpose of Avoiding Google: Reflect on why you want to avoid Google. Is it to protect your personal data, avoid targeted ads, or maintain a sense of privacy? Understanding your goals can help you make informed decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reality of Data Privacy: In today’s digital age, complete anonymity is challenging. Even if you avoid Google, other services and apps may still collect your data. It’s important to be realistic about what you can achieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effectiveness of Privacy Measures: Extreme privacy measures can be time-consuming and may not provide the level of protection you expect. Balancing privacy with practicality is crucial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security of Personal Information: While concerns about data privacy are valid, it’s also true that companies like Google invest heavily in securing their servers. Your personal information is generally safe with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact on Daily Life: Overemphasizing privacy can sometimes hinder your ability to enjoy and use technology effectively. Finding a balance that works for you is key.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="safety-net">safety net</h3>
<p>Safety Net was Google&rsquo;s system to validate a platform&rsquo;s security and allowed app developes to prevent use on a compromised (rooted) system. The Universal Safety Net Fix(USNF) solves this issue and and enabled users to use apps that try to detect a rooted system.</p>
<p>Google has since deprecated Safety Net for a more aggressive root detection system call Play Integrity. Play Integrity has various levels of trust and in the initial rollout it functioned just like Safety Net. Recently they have made it look into other aspects of the system to determine if the system is compromise. This new detection method has rendered USNF obsolete and ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>I use firefox for ideological reasons, and also for its features. Chrome/brave and other chromium based browser are all under the same Google umbrella. Firefox is the only real non-google alternative.</p>
