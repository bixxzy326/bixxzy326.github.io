    <h3 id="why-write">Why write?</h3>
<p>Writing as crystallized thought, a way of expressing the labyrinth of interconnected, messy, and many time incoherent ideas in my mind. It is a form of knowledge distillation.</p>
<p>I feel molding thoughts into new forms through language and terminology can give it a new perspective.</p>
<p><strong>I just want you to read the below post as this kuttiee suggests:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query">https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query</a>
<ul>
<li>Writing for a general public, you need to be broad and a bit bland. I didn’t want a general public. I wanted a specific set of people, the people who could help me along as a human being obsessed with certain intellectual problems. I didn’t know who these people were. I only knew that they existed. Hence my writing was a search query. It needed to be phrased in such a way that it found these people and, if necessary, filtered others.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>A blog post is a search query. You write to find your tribe; you write so they will know what kind of fascinating things they should route to your inbox.</em></p>
<p>Ted Chiang on the power of written language in Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn’t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.</p>
