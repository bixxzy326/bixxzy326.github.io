<p>Yes, a substance abuse problem. We are consuming a lot of information irrelevant to our willness but that will eventually get used to us and also this will comfort us making us not realize that it sucks our time and that procastination that done is by video content majorly. The one thing i noticed in me that, i have been consuming a lot of reels when i see my digital welbeing dashboard and realizing that these are my peak time which i should stipulate for upskilling myself.</p>
<p>Giving us a break to ourselves doesn&rsquo;t mean that we have to stipulate for the screentime. Sometime we feel like that gives the social awareness of whats happening outside the world. But along with that we are suggested and pushed with our own tuned algorithm just for our wish. This include video, image and much more social media formats.</p>
<p>I personally feel that this video and image will reduce our reading. we are constricted ourselves that we get everything here in the social media and often getting back to social media with our own muscle memory. I personally like the practice of surfing web and seek for some good blogs which will be in their perspective and will convey what they actually feel which i personally like.</p>
<p>I felt many times that when I take my phone for something and I will unknowingly ended up seeing some reels instead of the actual work i came for my phone. This looks silly one, but for me it is the greatest distraction of all time which i need to restrict at any cost.</p>
