      <description>Started with my first wiki contribution For a long time, I was planning to contribute wikipedia as a part of my archival process and long term helpful journey that people would benefit outta it, and then our collective hosted a mediawiki called FSHM wiki which inturn paved my path to contribute it. But I dont have a list of concrete plan to contribute considering my landscape.&#xA;By then, I get to see wiki page of Fosscell NITC, which they have a list of Campus guide which seems informational and helpful to anyone who wanna join there as a fresher.</description>
