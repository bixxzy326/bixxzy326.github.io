      <description>Substance consuming Problem?? Yes, a substance abuse problem. We are consuming a lot of information irrelevant to our willness but that will eventually get used to us and also this will comfort us making us not realize that it sucks our time and that procastination that done is by video content majorly. The one thing i noticed in me that, i have been consuming a lot of reels when i see my digital welbeing dashboard and realizing that these are my peak time which i should stipulate for upskilling myself.</description>
