      <description>As noordine asked me to write a note for myself that what i observed as a secretary, here it goes&#xA;There is a constant need of our mind-share with our poeple and also with the new people. I should make them feel inclusive in every aspect and induce the learning into them. Experience that i got from SOTC to run an effective meeting make a clear agenda for every meeting meeting host should be clear to the point of what need to be discussed maintain &amp;lt;5 attendees in the meeting make them feel included share them the responsibility make sure all ec members are attending when it is a decision making meeting have a peer-review for everyone and share their work done in the collective for the past month(drives and outcomes) Take minutes of meeting in rotation basis with attendees list, agenda, summary, date, time and opinions shared.</description>
