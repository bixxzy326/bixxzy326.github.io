      <description> This question always strikes me, whenever people over here are apolitical&#xA;they are comfortable with the current political climate people doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about how society is functioning or they may be extremely priveledged they will throw money and think that their problem disappear and not the society problem. they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the social issues around them becasue it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect them. they may be willfully ignorant and they avoid forming opinion because it will burst their precious priveledged bubble </description>
